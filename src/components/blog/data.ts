<h2>The Resume Problem Nobody Wants to Talk About</h2>
<p>Imagine spending three weeks reviewing 200 resumes, shortlisting 20 candidates, interviewing 8, and making a hire — only to discover six months later that the person cannot do the job. This scenario plays out thousands of times every day in companies around the world.</p>
<p>The resume, which has barely changed since the 1950s, is still the primary hiring filter for most organisations. Yet studies consistently show that resume-based hiring produces poor outcomes. According to research by Leadership IQ, 46% of newly hired employees will fail within 18 months.</p>
<blockquote>"Resumes tell you what a candidate claims they can do. SkillMatch Pro shows you what they actually can do. The difference is everything."</blockquote>
<h2>What "Verified Skills" Actually Means</h2>
<p>A verified skill is not a self-reported competency on a LinkedIn profile. It is a demonstrated capability — proven through the completion of a standardised, objective, real-world task under controlled conditions.</p>

<h2>The Real Cost of a Bad Hire</h2>
<p>Ask any HR leader what their biggest pain point is and "bad hires" will almost always rank in the top three. The U.S. Department of Labor estimates that the average cost of a bad hire equals 30% of the employee's first-year salary.</p>
<div class="art-stat-box">
  <div><div class="asb-num">30%</div><div class="asb-lbl">Of first-year salary lost per bad hire</div></div>

  <div><div class="asb-num">92%</div><div class="asb-lbl">Retention rate for SkillMatch Pro hires at 12mo</div></div>
</div>
<h2>Why Bad Hires Happen</h2>
<p>Bad hires rarely happen because of outright deception. They happen because the hiring process is fundamentally misaligned with job performance. Interviews measure confidence and articulation. Resumes measure self-promotion ability. Neither measures actual job performance.</p>
